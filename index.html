          <p><strong>Backstory:</strong></p>
          <p>
            <strong>Conventional Wisdom:</strong> Individuals, Influencers,
            Media, Organizations, and Companies should only focus on issues that
            impact their target audience, market, niche, or sphere because doing
            otherwise only distracts from their stated purpose, goals, mission,
            etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Unconventional Wisdom:</strong> The problem with this line
            of thinking and behavior is that even if you’re successful in your
            niche, you run the risk and the very real possibility that one,
            three, or five years down the road you might not be conducting
            business as usual or even have a business.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are at the tipping point for issues of climate change, pollution,
            pandemics, economic inequalities, food, and water inequalities, and
            health inequalities — where any one of these issues can overrun any
            business or organization on a local, national, or global scale.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you think you’re not going to be affected because you’re too
            small or too big — well, it may be one of your key suppliers that’s
            affected and that essentially cuts your business or kills it. It may
            be that your customer base is adversely affected. It may be that
            your geography and your infrastructure are severely damaged.
          </p>
          <p>
            All these things are occurring today, but the real problem is when
            they escalate in the coming years will you have a job or a business
            to go to?

        <h2>AUTHOR</h2>
        <h3>WAM! WORDS & ACTIONS MATTER.</h3>
        <p>
          Despite not learning to read until he was in third grade, and not
          being “officially” diagnosed with dyslexia until he was in his early
          30’s, Benjamin has had a truly remarkable relationship with the
          written word.
        </p>
        <p>
          From his time in high school when he uncovered a mistake in
          Hemingway’s writings to starting the school’s literary magazine at the
          University of Florida to his creative, feature, legal and technical
          writing — Benjamin has a knack for providing a unique focus on
          subjects of interest to others.
        </p>
        <p>
          Benjamin is the only person ever to be the publisher of a major
          newsstand magazine (<em>Relationships Today</em>) and a best-selling
          board game (<em>Romantic Journey</em>) at the same time. His romantic
          comedy movie script was picked up by Video Corporation of America (but
          they couldn’t come to terms) and his only sci-fi novel —
          <i>A Not So Delicate Balance</i> — was accepted for hardback
          publication by Bantam Books provided that he creates a subplot to meet
          their minimum page requirements. (Much to the unhappiness of his then
          literary agent, Benjamin decided to pursue his business interests
          instead.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Benjamin writes not for the money, but to create works with unique
          perspectives on subjects that might already be viewed differently in
          people’s mindsets.
        </p>
        <p>
          He has created and written television shows; movie scripts, novels and
          industry-related books including (<i>My Movie with Nicole Kidman</i>
          and <i>Locations Etc’s Event Site Finders Directory</i>) as well as
          comic strips, song lyrics and board games.
        </p>
        <p>
          His game designs caught the attention of Hasbro and he was invited to
          present and tour their headquarters just because they were interested
          in meeting him and offering encouragement. (They don’t accept games
          from outside developers.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Benjamin was also invited to China by a billion dollar company to
          discuss the development of groundbreaking interactive computer games
          for their network of Karaoke clubs. Unfortunately, after loving what
          he presented they asked him to commit to moving to China for two years
          (something that was never discussed previously) and Benjamin refused
          due to the importance of his non-profit work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, Benjamin is finishing up work on four books scheduled to launch
          in conjunction with 2023: The Year of One Planet One People.

        <h3>
          PROVIDING GROUNDBREAKING QUALITY OF LIFE SOLUTIONS ON SOCIAL, ECONOMIC
          & HEALTH ISSUES.
        </h3>
        <img

        />
        <h4>TED TALKS IS ALL ABOUT THAT ONE BIG IDEA.</h4>
        <p>
          Frankly, there is nothing bigger than providing Quality of Life for 8
          billion residents of Planet Earth. But to actually have a realistic
          shot at accomplishing it, it has to be much more than an idea. It has
          to be a series of scalable systems that work together for both
          individuals and institutions and literally provide actionable
          solutions to national and global issues.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your Issue, Your Cause, Your Mission is Lyle’s Issue, Cause & Mission.
          Simply put, Lyle’s Topics are Your Topics because that’s what it’s
          going to take to change the world and provide Quality of Life for
          Kids, People & The Planet.
        </p>
        <h4>ENGAGEMENTS, PUBLICITY & SOCIAL MEDIA, OH MY!</h4>
        <p>
          To say Lyle’s “Quality of Life for All” agenda is ambitious is
          probably the understatement of the decade, if not the century. But
          what you have to understand is that we are not looking for 100%
          engagement, or even 50%, 25%, or 10%. One or two percent is all that
          is needed in the beginning to start to tip the scales in our favor.
        </p>
        <p>
          But to do that, we need your help. We need to introduce our programs
          and initiatives to individuals, influencers, and institutions on a
          local, national and global scale. Together, we can show people how
          they are not powerless to affect positive change in the world … that
          no matter who you are, you’re more connected and powerful than you
          might realize. Be the change you want to see in the world. Join us and
          learn how to “Be The Hero” for yourself, your family, and the Planet.
